      Welcome to my website where I post my projects and things I'm doing at the moment.<br><br>Hi, my name is DarkBrave! I code in Java and make small GUI and non GUI apps,
      as well as Minecraft plugins made with the Bukkit/Spigot server plugin API. I've also done some small things in the Unity game engine with C#, but I've also tried other tools as well.
      I also make small web stuff in HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript. I have a Ryzen 5 3600, 16GB DRAM,
      Radeon RX 580, 256GB SSD, 2TB HDD computer with a Windows 11 Arch Linux (KDE Plasma) dual-boot. I like to mess around with other operating systems like older versions of Windows
      and other Linux distributions in virtual machines. I play Minecraft and enjoy building structures and messing around with redstone and other mechanics. I play on an SMP with
      some friends where we have lots of fun playing survival together. I'm interested in spaceflight and watch a lot of videos about it as well as keeping up with every development.
      I play a game called Kerbal Space Program where you build and launch spacecraft in a mostly realistic physics simulator, but it's a lot of fun to mess around in. 
      I hope this gives you a nice overview of me and what I do, I will update this as things change.

    <h2>My Updates</h2>

      <p><b>Update 5 | Dec 6, 2023</b></p>
      <div class="grid-container">
          <div class="grid-item"><p>
              Hey all of you wonderful people! Yes, I'm not dead, though the website may make you think so, but I've been really busy. It's been over a full two years since the last
              update, so it's time for another one. Important thing: I'm now DarkBrave, not longer DarkBrave_ since the Minecraft username became available. Anyway, let's get into this,
              with the same categories as last time, plus a few extra.
          </p></div><div class="grid-item"></div>
          <div class="grid-item>"><img alt="Last update was on August 21st, 2021." src="../images/updates/5/update.png"></div>
          <div class="grid-item"><p>
              So first off: the website itself. The new title bar is cool, and helps make the site look very clean and cool. Also, there's a cool static in the background with a more dark
              overlay as well. Also, I've been planning to add a ramblings section for a while now, and I'm glad I finally made it. Expect more random things there like product reviews
              and memories I have. The first one about the Apple Watch is already up now! Think of it as a public diary, but actually worth reading, and I hope you all enjoy it.
          </p></div><div class="grid-item"></div>
          <div class="grid-item"><img alt="The new CSS changes to the website." src="../images/updates/5/website.png"></div>
          <div class="grid-item"><p>
              LightningCore is dead. Hate to say it, but it just is dead now. DarkBrave is where I'm going to put that stuff now, since I don't care about doing YouTube the "right"
              way anymore. I'm leaving the intro video up for my archivist brain, but don't expect the video's promises to hold true. Instead, I made a podcast with some friends about
              a few months after that last update. It's called We're All Video Game Nerds, and has four episodes. It's about Nintendo games and just general fun games we enjoy.
              Nothing has been recorded in the past year and two thirds, but we are planning a revival episode every once in a while. Other than that, it's mostly pretty boring.
          </p></div><div class="grid-item"></div>
          <div class="grid-item"><img alt="The We're All Video Game Nerds podcast." src="../images/updates/5/wavgn.png"></div>
          <div class="grid-item"><p>
              I've got to split Minecraft up into two parts: my own worlds and FishCraft. For my own worlds, I pretty much discontinued the Redstone Testing World since I don't
              do much of that anymore. It's still around, just not used very much. I was able to locate my old Free Build World from before the Vault Corruption and have built a
              lot on it. I haven't actually done much on it, but in 2021 I did daily livestreams on it between Christmas and New Years. On the second day of 2022, I did a collab
              with Choo and Mio where we messed around. It's by far the best content on my channel so far.
          </p></div><div class="grid-item"></div>
          <div class="grid-item"><img alt="The Free Build World." src="../images/updates/5/freebuild.png"></div>
          <div class="grid-item"><p>
              FishCraft had a lot of work done on it. The plan in the old update for FishCraft 2 did hold true in January 2022, except DarkPhoenixx became only involved in occasional
              events. He just doesn't like the game that much, and that's okay in my books. We've moved away from Realms onto a dedicated Oracle Cloud server for the host, and it's way
              better. This lets us have a Modded server that was great for quite a while on it. Creative has a lot of cool things, watching WWDC22 and Zack Freedman while building
              the aquarium, stadium, laboratory, (my favorite build maybe ever on a server) and Redstone computers was a lot of fun. Survival was very cool, and if you want to
              watch that unfold, just watch my video streams on YouTube. It's too much to say here, you just gotta watch it. You may notice I'm referring to FishCraft in past tense,
              and that's for a reason. To be honest, it's been mostly dead since 2022, mostly since that's when we banned the troublemaker! It wouldn't be a DarkBrave server without
              it being blown up! Nothing at all has happened since then, and that has resulted in a lack of activity since then online.
          </p></div><div class="grid-item"></div>
          <div class="grid-item"><img alt="Image of the Vault not mounting." src="../images/updates/5/fishcraft.png"></div>
          <div class="grid-item"><p>
              So actually you may notice I said Zack Freedman earlier. Yes, I got a 3D printer in late 2022. It's an Ender 3 V2 Neo and has taken over my life. From Freedman's
              Gridfinity modular storage that I love to Fort Rocks, there's a lot of fun to be had. There were some issues at first with the firmware, but Octoprint and MRISOC has
              resolved that. Check out my models on Printables if you want to see what I've been designing with my new Fusion360 skills I've learned. Yes, I now know CAD software,
              kill me, but at least Fusion 360 is free with a student license!
          </p></div><div class="grid-item"></div>
          <div class="grid-item"><img alt="Fort Rocks, AKA 3D prints with the rock's head." src="../images/updates/5/fortrocks.png"></div>
          <div class="grid-item"><p>
              I got a used 3DS in early 2022 and am absolutely loving it. I've spent so many hours in public transit on it, so I don't want to open the Activity Log to check. Of course I
              homebrewed it to dump my cartridges and play custom games! Before you say it, piracy is a crime, so I'm not doing that, only dumping games I own a physical or digital copy
              of. My Switch library has a few new titles, nothing crazy. Oh yeah, I also became addicted to Zelda during this past summer. It's been so much fun just playing Tears of the
              Kingdom, especially with friends on trips. There's so many hidden details and mechanics I could send days talking about, so I should make a rambling on it.
          </p></div><div class="grid-item"></div>
          <div class="grid-item"><img alt="Image I posted to Reddit of my 3DS games." src="../images/updates/5/3dsgames.jpg"></div>
          <div class="grid-item"><p>
              As for the computer, nothing major to say. Sorry, all I did was get an old M.2 drive from the PlayStation 5 in my computer. Also, I now fully dualboot Arch and
              Windows 11 now. (Bring Fusion 360 to Linux, Autodesk!) There's honestly not that much to talk about in terms of my computer and technology in the past few years excluding
              what I've already been talking about during this update. But that's it for my this update, so I think that covers it all for now my friends, so expect another hopefully in the
              next two years. I bet GTA 6 is going to come out before then.... Do expect more frequent ramblings from now on, (RSS anybody? Smash the feed subscribe button?) and have a
              great day, and hopefully great life!
