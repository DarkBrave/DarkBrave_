    <p>Update 3 | Dec 22, 2020</p>
    <p>
      Hello, and welcome to another update! I wanted to do these updates weekly, but I think they are going to becom bi-weekly.
      Anyway, I have been doing alot of Minecraft recently. Me and a friend started a world on a modpack called "Attack of the B-Team" and we've had a great time!
      We started doing the Advanced Genetics, and we think it could be improved upon greatly, and we also did some Witchery which is a magic mod that has some really cool stuff.
      We made a big smeltery using Tinkers Construct, and it smelts stuff really quickly and efficently. We used the Secret Rooms mod to hide our base and even hide rooms inside rooms.
      I've also been playing around in the new 1.17 snapshots with all of the new stuff. I think all of the new features are amazing and really add alot to the game.
      In Kerbal Space Program, we just got KSP 1.11 Some Re-Assembly Required, and I love it! The new inventory features, RCS and lights are amazing!
      I'm really glad I didn't launch my station until a few days after the release of the update. Speaking of which I made and launched an amazing space station to
      Low Kerblin-Orbit. I also am working on relay sats for a base to Minmus. This will be my first base in the game, and I want to launch it soon.
      Also, SpaceX's Starship SN8 did an amazing launch, and while it didn't land, it had an amazing launch. SN9 fell over in the high bay,
      Oops. Luckily it got repaired and is being sent out to the launch pad as I write this. I've also started playing a game called Hollow Night, but
      more on that, as I don't have much info on it now. That's it for this update, I hope you have an amazing holiday, and see you in two weeks!
