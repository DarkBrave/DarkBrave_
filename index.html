    <p>Update 2, Dec 1, 2020</p>
    <p>
      Wow! It's been a while since the previous update! Anyway, I have been playing alot of Kerbal Space Program and Minecraft recently.
      Way back in September, I launched a sucessful mission to the Mun and back.
      More recently, I also sucessfully launched a unmaned probe to Duna that had many science experiments and other stuff.
      I do have plans to launch a relay network and manned lander to Duna very soon.
      In Minecraft, the private SMP I play on (FishCraft) now has a government that abuses it's power to take down my shops.
      For that reason, I am temporarly leaving FishCraft for a while and am going to focus on other things in the game.
      I've also started a new survival world on my YouTube channel LIVE and it's going really well so far.
      The seed I got is very awesome, and I recomend you check it out. (3273674282623179236)
      I have epic plans for the world, however I might stop streaming if no one really cares about it.
      You can learn about more things I'm doing on my YouTube channel's streams and videos.
      That's it for this update, I hope you enjoy what I'm doing and have a great day!
