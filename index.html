      Welcome to my website where I post my projects and things I'm doing at the moment.<br>Hi, my name is DarkBrave. I code in Java and make small GUI and non GUI apps,
      as well as Minecraft plugins made with the bukkit/spigot server plugin API. I also make small web stuff in HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript. I have a Ryzen 5, 16GB DRAM,
      Radeon RX 580, 256GB SSD, 2TB HDD computer with a Windows 10 and Ubuntu 20.10 dual-boot. I like to mess around with other operating systems like older versions of Windows
      and other Linux distributions in virtual machines. I play Minecraft and enjoy building structures and messing around with redstone and other mechanics. I play on an SMP with
      some friends where we have lots of fun playing survival together. I'm interested in spaceflight and watch a lot of videos about it as well as keeping up with every development.
      I play a game called Kerbal Space Program where you build and launch spacecraft in a mostly realistic physics simulator.
      I hope this gives you a nice overview of me and what I do, I will update this as things change.

    <h2>My Updates</h2>

    <p>Update 4 | Aug 21, 2021</p>
      <div class="grid-container">
          <div class="grid-item"><p>
            Wow, it's been FOREVER since the last "update" on the website, which was on December 22, 2020. I even said they would become bi-weekly,
            but you can probably tell that never happened. But today, I thought I'd actually start those updates back up, and a new one will come out on every other weekend (hopefully.)
            On to what I've actually been doing now.
          </p></div><div class="grid-item"></div>
          <div class="grid-item>"><img alt="Last update was on December 22, 2020." src="./images/updates/4/update.png"></div>
          <div class="grid-item"><p>
            You may have noticed the new look for this website, which also means the "No CSS" splash text is outdated.
            I've been working a bit over the past month or so to make this website more than text on a white background. There's now a background behind the content,
            which is actually my logo without the text part, and it also has a gray translucent overlay to make it look nicer.
            I also added padding around the website to make it a bit nicer, as according to DarkPhoenixx it looked too much like a big wall of text,
            which is technically still is, but it looks better. I also added some fonts to the site, so yeah. Eventually the "Projects" section will have photos and descriptions,
            but I'm not too worried about that right now.
          </p></div><div class="grid-item"></div>

          <div class="grid-item"><p>
            I've now created a new channel called LightningCore,
            my reason for this is so that I can make higher-quality edited videos and even work on others. I even made a special set in Minecraft to film it in that includes a:
            throne, desk, bookshelves, tv, coffee table with chairs, bedroom with bed and shelves, and a filming room (ironic) with green screen and camera. Pretty cool if you ask me.
          </p></div><div class="grid-item"></div>
          <div class="grid-item"><img alt="The set I built for LightningCore." src="./images/updates/4/set.png"></div>
          <div class="grid-item"><p>
            On FishCraft, my base got blown up (again,) for crazy reasons that are too complicated to explain here. Luckily DarkPhoenixx agreed to do a rollback of the world,
            so the drama is basically over. I got a riptide trident and added a rooftop pool to my base, so everyone can have a party and launch ourselves into the air. Due to 1.18
            we are planning FishCraft 2 Electric Boogaloo, which will have numerous improvements to prevent conflict, and other really cool features like custom plugins and datapacks.
            DarkPhoenixx will become the social admin, aka the person who manages the bans/kicks, events, and rules/laws. I will become the technical admin and manage the server its self.

            There is one sad thing that happened,  the Vault got corrupted so most of my original quality videos and old logos were lost,
            along with my virtual machines and free software collection, not to mention the sheer amount of unreleased code.
            I was able to recover my Minecraft and KSP save data from a backup from February, but you know not much happened between now and then.
            Oh yeah, and I started dualbooting Windows and Linux, originally using Ubuntu, then Kubuntu, then later adding Arch Linux and Fedora, however I'm removing Fedora now.
            That's really it for the really overdue half a year later post, so I'll see you in two weeks for the next update!
