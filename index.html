    <p>Update 1, Sep 14 2020</p>
    <p>
      Welcome to the first update of my website!
      I am currently working on making this website the place to come and learn about what I'm doing.
      Yes, I will add CSS to the website eventually. (Even though it probably will look better right now than it would if I add CSS)
      I have been playing a simulator game called Kerbal Space Program, which lets you design and fly rockets, I am still yet to make it to the Můn though.
      Anyway, that is all for this update, see you next update.
