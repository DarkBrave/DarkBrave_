        Welcome to this section of my website in which I'll be writing about a bunch of random things, hence the name. Whether it's a review of my phone all the way to
        what drink mixes I make at a fast food place, it's all here. Every date is in DD/MM/YY because screw Americans (just kidding!), and everything is sorted by year.
        Click on a title to go to that page, and click on the website title on the navigation bar to go back to head home. For legal reasons, do not expect any info
        on this page to be 100% accurate, although I'm trying my best to make it as accurate as possible. Please DM me (contact on main page) if there's any big issues I
        need to fix!
