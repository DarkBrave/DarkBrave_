        <p>Update 2, Dec 1, 2020</p>
        <p>
          Wow! It's been a while since the previous update! Anyway, I have been playing alot of Kerbal Space Program and Minecraft recently.
          Way back in September, I launched a sucessful mission to the Mun and back.
          More recently, I also sucessfully launched a unmaned probe to Duna that had many science experiments and other stuff.
          I do have plans to launch a relay network and manned lander to Duna very soon.
          In Minecraft, the private SMP I play on (FishCraft) now has a government that abuses it's power to take down my shops.
          For that reason, I am temporarly leaving FishCraft for a while and am going to focus on other things in the game.
          I've also started a new survival world on my YouTube channel LIVE and it's going really well so far.
          The seed I got is very awesome, and I recomend you check it out. (3273674282623179236)
          I have epic plans for the world, however I might stop streaming if no one really cares about it.
          You can learn about more things I'm doing on my YouTube channel's streams and videos.
          That's it for this update, I hope you enjoy what I'm doing and have a great day!

        <p>Update 1, Sep 14, 2020</p>
        <p>
          Welcome to the first update of my website!
          I am currently working on making this website the place to come and learn about what I'm doing.
          Yes, I will add CSS to the website eventually. (Even though it probably will look better right now than it would if I add CSS)
          I have been playing a simulator game called Kerbal Space Program, which lets you design and fly rockets, I am still yet to make it to the Mun though.
          Anyway, that is all for this update, see you next update.
