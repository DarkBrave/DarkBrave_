        <p><b>Update 3 | Dec 22, 2020</b></p>
        <p>
          Hello, and welcome to another update! I wanted to do these updates weekly, but I think they are going to become bi-weekly.
          Anyway, I have been doing a lot of Minecraft recently. Me and a friend started a world on a modpack called "Attack of the B-Team" and we've had a great time so far!
          We started doing the Advanced Genetics mod, and we think it could be improved upon greatly, and we also did some Witchery which is a magic mod that has some really cool stuff.
          We made a big smeltery using Tinkers Construct, and it smelts stuff really quickly and efficently. We used the Secret Rooms mod to hide our base and even hide rooms inside rooms.
          I've also been playing around in the new 1.17 snapshots with all of the new stuff. I think all of the new features are amazing and really add alot to the game.
          In Kerbal Space Program, we just got KSP 1.11 Some Re-Assembly Required, and I love it! The new inventory features, RCS and lights are amazing!
          I'm really glad I didn't launch my station until a few days after the release of the update. Speaking of which I made and launched an amazing space station to
          Low Kerblin-Orbit. I also am working on relay sats for a base to Minmus. This will be my first base in the game, and I want to launch it soon.
          Also, SpaceX's Starship SN8 did an amazing launch, and while it didn't land, it had an amazing launch. However, SN9 fell over in the high bay,
          oops. Luckily it got repaired and is being sent out to the launch pad as I write this. I've also started playing a game called Hollow Night, but
          more on that next update, as I don't have much info on it now. That's it for this update, I hope you have an amazing holiday, stay safe, and see you in two weeks!

          Wow! It's been a while since the previous update! Anyway, I have been playing alot of Kerbal Space Program and Minecraft recently.
          Way back in September, I launched a sucessful mission to the Mun and back.
          More recently, I also sucessfully launched a unmaned probe to Duna that had many science experiments and other stuff.
          I do have plans to launch a relay network and manned lander to Duna very soon.
          In Minecraft, the private SMP I play on (FishCraft) now has a government that abuses it's power to take down my shops.
          For that reason, I am temporarly leaving FishCraft for a while and am going to focus on other things in the game.
          I've also started a new survival world on my YouTube channel LIVE and it's going really well so far.
          The seed I got is very awesome, and I recomend you check it out. (3273674282623179236)
          I have epic plans for the world, however I might stop streaming if no one really cares about it.
          You can learn about more things I'm doing on my YouTube channel's streams and videos.
          That's it for this update, I hope you enjoy what I'm doing and have a great day!

          Welcome to the first update of my website!
          I am currently working on making this website the place to come and learn about what I'm doing.
          Yes, I will add CSS to the website eventually. (Even though it probably will look better right now than it would if I add CSS)
          I have been playing a simulator game called Kerbal Space Program, which lets you design and fly rockets, I am still yet to make it to the Mun though.
          Anyway, that is all for this update, see you next update.
